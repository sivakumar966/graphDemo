# Line chart using D3.js and Angular
This development involves creating an interactive line chart using D3.js within an Angular application. The chart visualizes a simple line between two points while providing user-friendly features, including grid lines, axis labelling, and a tooltip that displays real-time data points on hover.


## Features
  ### Grid Lines:
   Major and minor grid lines.

    
  ### X and Y Axes:
   custom input for x and y axis.
  
  ### Interactive Tooltip :
   A tooltip appears when the user hovers over the line. This tooltip dynamically displays the current X and Y values based on the mouse position, offering immediate feedback on the data represented by the chart.
   The tooltip's position follows the mouse cursor, improving accessibility and user experience.
